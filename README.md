# Facial Expression Recognition

### Description

In this project we have implemented various deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks to identify six main human emotions that are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and lack thereof (neutrality). We have used two datasets, one is Kaggleâ€™s Facial Expression Recognition(FER) and another is Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces(KDEF) dataset. The architecture we have applied for our Convolutional Neural Networks were VGG16 and ResNet50. The accuracy we have got using FER dataset was 64.3% using our CNN architecture and the accuracy we have got from KDEF dataset was 81.1% using VGG-16, 67.8% using ResNet50 architecture.
